# Classification-of-heart-disease
The "Classification of Heart Disease using Machine Learning" project is a data-driven endeavor aimed at developing an accurate and robust model to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in individuals based on a set of medical attributes. Heart disease is a critical health concern, and this project leverages the power of machine learning to assist in early diagnosis, enabling timely medical intervention and improving patient outcomes.

**Technologies Used** :
Programming Languages:
Python: The primary programming language for data preprocessing, model development, training, evaluation, and deployment.

Data Analysis and Manipulation:
pandas: Python library for data manipulation and analysis, used for loading, cleaning, and preprocessing the dataset.

Machine Learning Libraries:
scikit-learn: Essential library for machine learning tasks, including model selection, training, and evaluation.
TensorFlow / Keras: Deep learning libraries for building neural networks if you decide to explore more complex models.

Data Visualization:
Matplotlib: Library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
Seaborn: Statistical data visualization library that works well with pandas DataFrames.
