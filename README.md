# Classification-of-heart-disease
The "Classification of Heart Disease using Machine Learning" project is a data-driven endeavor aimed at developing an accurate and robust model to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in individuals based on a set of medical attributes. Heart disease is a critical health concern, and this project leverages the power of machine learning to assist in early diagnosis, enabling timely medical intervention and improving patient outcomes.
